       "\"## Comprehensive Analysis of PG&E's Undergrounding Proposal in A.21-06-021 and Decision 23-11-069\\n\\nThis analysis synthesizes the public record in proceeding A.21-06-021 and Decision 23-11-069 to provide a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory landscape surrounding PG&E's undergrounding proposal. It encompasses the evolution of the proposal, the CPUC's rationale for modifications, a comparative analysis of the Proposed Decision (PD) and Alternate Proposed Decision (APD), and considerations of cost-effectiveness and timelines.\\n\\n### 1. Comparison of Undergrounding Miles: PG&E's Proposal vs. CPUC Authorization\\n\\n*   **Initial Proposal:** PG&E initially proposed undergrounding **3,600 miles** of distribution lines, announced in February 2022, as part of its broader **10,000-mile** undergrounding concept announced in late 2021. [[A.21-06-021, Proposed Decision, p. 249](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K418/520418881.PDF), [A.21-06-021, Alternate, p. 248](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K114/520114360.PDF), [A2306008, Brief, p. 4](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M545/K343/545343978.PDF), [A.21-06-021, Brief, p. 379](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M498/K814/498814881.PDF]]\\n*   **Reasons for Adjustments:** PG&E significantly reduced its undergrounding proposal due to concerns about its **executability**.
