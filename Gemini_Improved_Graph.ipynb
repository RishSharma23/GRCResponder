      "*   **PG&E's Modified Proposal:** PG&E later modified its proposal in its Reply Brief, decreasing the proposed underground mileage in 2023-2026 from approximately 3,300 miles to **2,100 miles**, reducing forecast expenditures by $4.05 billion to a new requested figure of **$6.13 billion** (Source: {'chunk_index': 1, 'document_id': '501533409', 'proceeding_id': 'A2106021', 'source_url': 'https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M501/K533/501533409.PDF'}).\n",

Comparison of Undergrounding Miles: PG&E Request vs. CPUC Approval\\n\\n*   **PG&E\\'s Original Proposal:** PG&E initially proposed to underground approximately **3,300 miles** from 2023 to 2026, at a forecast cost of approximately **$9,980 million** (Source: {\\'chunk_index\\': 815, \\'document_id\\': \\'499888041\\', \\'proceeding_id\\': \\'A2106021\\', \\'source_url\\': \\'https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M499/K888/499888041.PDF\\'}).\\n*   **PG&E\\'s Modified Proposal:** PG&E later modified its proposal in its Reply Brief, decreasing the proposed underground mileage in 2023-2026 from approximately 3,300 miles to **2,100 miles**, reducing forecast expenditures by $4.05 billion to a new requested figure of **$6.13 billion** (Source: {\\'chunk_index\\': 1, \\'document_id\\': \\'501533409\\', \\'proceeding_id\\': \\'A2106021\\', \\'source_url\\': \\'https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M501/K533/501533409.PDF\\'}).\\n*   **CPUC Authorized:** The Commission authorized PG&E to underground **1,230 miles** and install **778 miles of covered conductor** at a cost of **$4.723 billion** in 2023-2026 (Source: {\\'chunk_index\\': 42, \\'document_id\\': \\'543719453\\', \\'proceeding_id\\': \\'A2106021\\', \\'source_url\\': \\'https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M543/K719/543719453.PDF\\'}).\\n*   **Rationale for Reduction:** The Commission adopted a \"hybrid approach\" that balances PG&E\\'s and TURN\\'s (The Utility Reform Network) system hardening proposals, finding it \"more reasonable from an affordability perspective\" (Source: {\\'chunk_index\\': 42, \\'document_id\\': \\'543719453\\', \\'proceeding_id\\': \\'A2106021\\', \\'source_url\\': \\'https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M543/K719/543719453.PDF\\'}).
