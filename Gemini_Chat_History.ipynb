These services are consistent with the Affiliate Transaction Rules, Rule VII, adopted by the Commission in D.06-12-029 (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [Ex-06 at 2-17](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K418/520418881.PDF)).\\n\\n**Examples of Non-Tariffed Products and Services**\\n\\nTypical transactions under this program include (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [Ex-06](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K418/520418881.PDF)):\\n\\n*   Joint use pole attachment arrangements\\n*   Short-term use of conference facilities by third-parties\\n*   Customer emergency transformer loans\\n\\n**Financial Aspects and Regulatory Oversight**\\n\\nPG&E requested an expense forecast for 2023 of $49.851 million for the New Revenue Development Department’s provision of Non-Tariffed Products and Services (NTP&S) (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [520114360.PDF](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K114/520114360.PDF)). PG&E's forecasted revenues for 2023 were $60.5 million (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [520114360.PDF](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K114/520114360.PDF)).\\n\\nPG&E presents minimal information about the utility assets relied upon and other financial aspects of its Non-Tariffed Products and Services (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [520114360.PDF](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K114/520114360.PDF)). PG&E states that its request of $49.851 million supports “PG&E’s efforts to offer additional services [non-utility services] with existing assets [utility assets] to generate revenue, which reduces the costs of service in customer rates” (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [520114360.PDF](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K114/520114360.PDF)).\\n\\nMost of the information provided about profits and expenses for Non-Tariffed Products and Services is provided by PG&E annually pursuant to D.97-12-088, as modified by D.06-12-029, and Rule VII.H of the Affiliate Transactions Rules (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [520526938.PDF](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K526/520526938.PDF)).\\n\\n**Concerns and Lack of Transparency**\\n\\nIt has been noted that details regarding how PG&E implements a reduction “in cost of service in customer rates” are not provided (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [520526938.PDF](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K526/520526938.PDF)). The amount of overall financial support provided by shareholders (who share in the profits) is particularly difficult to discern from the information provided by PG&E (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [520526938.PDF](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K526/520526938.PDF)). While PG&E forecasts profits, it does not provide evidence in the form of specific business transactions or executed contracts to support its forecast of actual profits during the rate case period on a forward-looking basis (PG&E GRC A.21-06-021, [520114360.PDF](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M520/K114/520114360.PDF)).\\n\\nWould you like me to explore any aspect of this response in greater depth or address related regulatory considerations?\",\n",

      "GRC Assistant: The Decision justifies the self-insurance framework as being in the public interest for several reasons, primarily related to cost savings for ratepayers and reduced exposure to volatile insurance market conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Reduced Costs:** In the near term, ratepayers will not have to cover procurement fees and taxes associated with third-party insurance. In the long term, once the self-insurance target of $460 million is reached, ratepayers will no longer need to pay the related cost, which is currently $96 million per year (A.21-06-021, p. 19).\n",
      "*   **Savings for Ratepayers**: Self-insurance can result in overall cost savings compared to commercial insurance, especially with increasing premiums. If funds are not needed to cover losses in a given year, the excess revenue accumulates and is available for claims in subsequent years, unlike commercial insurance where premiums are typically kept by insurers regardless of claims (PG&E 2023 GRC, Exhibit 4, p.1).\n",
      "*   **Mitigation of Premium Volatility:** Self-insurance reduces PG&E’s exposure to insurance market volatility, such as sharp premium increases, changes in coverage, and reductions in market capacity (PG&E 2023 GRC, Exhibit 4).\n",
      "*   **Modeled After Wildfire Self-Insurance Programs:** The self-insurance proposal is modeled after the wildfire self-insurance programs the Commission approved for PG&E and Southern California Edison Company (PG&E 2023 GRC, Exhibit 4).\n",
      "*   **Flexibility in Funding:** Self-insurance funds may grow during the time between a third-party liability event occurring and when settlement payments are made. This differs from commercial insurance, where the entire premium is paid annually (PG&E 2023 GRC, Exhibit 4).\n",
      "\n",

Here's a breakdown of the key motivations:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Improved Outreach to Underserved Communities:** PG&E aimed to enhance its outreach to underserved communities by collaborating with CBOs. These organizations can disseminate information in multiple languages about financial assistance and bill savings programs, rate options, wildfire safety-related topics, and emergency preparedness, thus helping to reach vulnerable customers (A2106021, 397495992.PDF, p. 3).\n",
      "*   **Engagement with Vulnerable Communities:** PG&E engaged with organizations like TURN (The Utility Reform Network), CforAT (Center for Accessible Technology), Cal Advocates, and NDC (National Diversity Coalition) to ensure that the voices of their constituents were heard in developing the CSO Closure and Transformation Proposal. This collaboration was intended as an example of engagement to ensure that vulnerable communities were properly considered (A2204016, 498525940.PDF, p. 15).\n",
      "*   **Compensation for Collaboration:** PG&E indicated that it would compensate CBOs for their collaboration in outreach efforts (A2204016, 498525940.PDF, p. 15).\n",
